# ðŸ¥© Staking & Unstaking

#### **Staking your Ether was never this much easy, you can stake your Ether with just 3 clicks!**

{% hint style="success" %}
#### **You can always unstake your vEth2 to get Eth, until they are locked into the Eth2. Plenty of time to consider after starting to earn!**
{% endhint %}

When ETH is deposited, users get a wrapper token called vETH2. vETH2 is a staking derivative redeemable for ETH on SharedStake when Ethereum 2 launches. Its goal is to be liquid so that users can exit their position earlier on DEXâ€™s, as well as harnessing the power of DeFi and its composability benefits. For instance, one could lend vETH2 and earn interest, whilst borrowers on the other side of the trade could perform margin trading.

The fees are priced in vETH2, so the amount received after deposit is slightly lower.
