* Then approve your transaction in your wallet

Once your transaction is approved on-chain, you will receive an equivalent amount of vEth2 that you can hold or use.

## Stake your vEth2 as well! 

* Stake your vEth2 in the [Earn Page](https://www.sharedstake.org/earn) if you want to earn yield immediately.
* Click on the vEth2 pool and input any amount to stake.

You can claim your rewards with the â€˜harvestâ€™ button **without** withdrawing your staked balance.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Infinite approval gives the maximum possible access to the staking contract and can be used for cost efficiencies. This is an advanced option and SharedStake developers do not advise its use for most users.
