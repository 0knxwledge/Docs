# üó≥Ô∏è DAO

The number one priority of the SharedStake DAO is improving the usability, functionality, and benefits of the platform through SIPs and voting with SGT.

Priority two is already underway: becoming an exemplary Decentralized Autonomous Organization. We believe in the power of community as much as we believe in what we code.

### SIPs

SharedStake Improvement Proposals \(SIPs\) describe standards for the SharedStake platform, including core protocol specifications, on-chain and off-chain implementations, contract improvements and various other protocol strategies.

SGT functions as a governance token on these proposals and DAO members discuss and vote on SIPs. Core developers then approve & implement the decisions in SIPs.

Anyone can suggest a proposal by providing a SIP draft in an issue on Github or reaching out to any of the technical contributors in one of our social channels \(discord, twitter, etc.\).

#### Voting will occur via the SGT snapshot.page:
