# ðŸ•´ DAO

The number one priority of the SharedStake DAO is improving the usability and functionality of the protocol through SIPs and voting with SGT.

Becoming an exemplary Decentralized Autonomous Organization is the most important thing for us because we believe in the power of community as much as we believe in what we code.

### SIPs

SharedStake Improvement Proposals \(SIPs\) describe standards for the SharedStake platform, including core protocol specifications, onchain and offchain implementations, contract improvements and various other protocol strategies.

SGT will function as a governance token on these proposals and DAO members will discuss and vote on SIPs. Core developers will then approve & implement the decisions in SIPs.

Anyone can suggest a proposal by providing a SIP draft by opening an issue on Github or  reaching out to any of the technical contributors from one of our social channels \(discord, telegram, etc.\).

#### Voting will occur via the SGT snapshot.page:
