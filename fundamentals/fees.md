description: What do centralized exchanges do with the 25+% of accrued APY?

# üëù Fees

**TL;DR: SharedStake offers the most convenient rates possible: 0.315% of deposit \(0.1 ETH per validator\) and only 5% of accrued APY after ETH2 migration completion**

Running a validator node is not free. SharedStake aims to keep the most Eth in our members' pockets as possible, however there are infrastructure costs associated with the staking setup and maintenance:

* 0.1 Eth fee per validator for validator lots of 10 and 100 to cover infrastructure and labour \(equal to 0.315%\)
* And only 5% from accrued APY when Ethereum 2 officially launches
* Fees are priced in vEth2, so the amount received after deposit may be slightly lower

This rate is significantly lower than any competitors. The rate will continue to be evaluated through SIPs for additional capital efficiencies for SGT DAO members.

**If users choose to withdraw their ETH before the validators have been created they will be refunded and fees deducted.**

**When the first lot of validators has been created and SGT governance is live, the fee structure will be included in SIPs for community approval.**
