# ðŸ’Ž Fundamentals

**Decentralized Autonomous Organization \(DAO\)** is a virtual entity that has a certain number of members or shareholders who collectively determine where the organization will allocate funds and how its operations will be structured. **SharedStake is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization** and is governed by SGT holder votes in SIPs.

**Staking** is the act of depositing 32 ETH to activate validator software that keeps Ethereum secure for everyone. 

**SharedStake Governance Token \(SGT\)** is the token for use in the SharedStake DAO and throughout SharedStake and DeFi partner products. 50% of the total supply is allocated for platform users with emissions spread over 2 years \(Eth2 deployment\). 

**vEth2** is the liquid representation of staked Ether. vEth2 is the token that earns additional yield compared to traditionally staked ether**.**

**Uniswap** is the first main exchange where you can swap ETH or other digital assets for SGT. You can also add liquidity to stake and receive additional yield.
