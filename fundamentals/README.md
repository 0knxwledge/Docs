**Decentralized Autonomous Organization \(DAO\)** is a virtual entity that has a certain number of members or shareholders who collectively determine where the organization will allocate funds and how its operations will be structured. **SharedStake is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization** and is governed by SGT holder votes in SIPs.

**Staking** is the act of depositing 32 ETH to activate validator software that keeps Ethereum secure for everyone. 

**SharedStake Governance Token \(SGT\)** is the token for use in the SharedStake DAO and throughout SharedStake and DeFi partner products. 50% of the total supply is allocated for platform users with emissions spread over 2 years \(Eth2 deployment\).
