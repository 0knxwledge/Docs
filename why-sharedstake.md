# ðŸ¤” Why SharedStake

SharedStake is an initial custodial staking service that allows anyone to stake their ETH without having to maintain or monitor validator nodes. Simply put, SharedStake removes friction associated with ETH 2 staking:

* **Any** amount of ETH can be staked by pooling on SharedStake
* The validators are run on AWS, one of the best cloud providers with industry-leading uptimes
* Thanks to our derivative staking token, vETH2, we are able to create a liquid market to allow participants to exit their positions or leverage DeFi apps, even before Ethereum 2 launches

**Deposit ETH to the SharedStake smart contract to automatically mint your staking token, and relax. Nothing else is required.**

SharedStake may be your StaaS solution if you want a stake in Ethereum 2.0 and:

* You don't have 32 Eth for a validator, \($54,400 currently\)
* You have more than 32 Eth but not an exact multiple \(required for ETH2\)
* You don't want to run your own validator or are concerned about slashing due to local energy conditions
* You don't want to create your own Eth2 deposit credential via the command line
* You want to earn yield from investing in Ethereum 2.0 with minimal risk
* You want to save on validator node infrastructure costs by sharing them
* You want to use your Ethereum while earning your staking profits \(9% APY currently\)
* You want to sleep soundly trusting industry standard cloud infrastructure with guaranteed uptime

**Using SharedStake, anyone can play a part in the future of decentralized finance. ðŸš€**
