# ðŸ¤” Why SharedStake

SharedStake is a custodial staking service allowing anyone to stake their ETH without having to maintain or monitor any validator nodes. Simply put, SharedStake removes all friction associated with ETH 2 staking:

* Any amount of ETH can be staked by pooling on SharedStake.
* The validators are run on AWS, one of the best cloud providers with industry-leading uptimes.
* Thanks to vETH2, our derivative staking token, we are able to create a liquid market which allows participants to exit their positions or leverage DeFi apps, even before Ethereum 2 launches.

Just deposit ETH to SharedStake smart contract to automatically mint your staking token, and relax. Nothing else is required.

SharedStake is great for you if you want to stake in Ethereum 2.0 and:

* Don't have 32 Eth for a validator, \(54400$ currently\).
* Have more than 32 Eth but not an exact multiple
* Don't want to run your own validator
* Don't want to create your own Eth2 deposit credential via the command line
* Want to earn APYs from investing in Ethereum 2.0 in a safer manner than DeFi.
* Save on validator node infrastructure costs by sharing them
* Want to use your Ethereum while earning your staking profits, yearly 9%  currently.
* Sleep soundly trusting industry standard cloud infrastructure with guaranteed uptime.

**Using SharedStake, anyone can play a part in the future of decentralized finance. ðŸš€**
