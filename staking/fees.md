# üëù Fees

**TL;DR: 0.315% of deposit \(0.1 ETH per validator\) and 5% of accrued APY on ETH2 migration completion**

As such running a validator node is not free. There are infrastructure costs associated with the recommended setup.

We propose

* 0.1 Eth fee per validator for the validator lots of 10 and 100 to cover infrastructure and labour.

This is 0.315% of a deposit.

We propose a 5% fee on accrued APY when Ethereum 2 has launched.

This is lower than any competitors.

**If users choose to withdraw their ETH before the validators have been created they will be refunded the fees deducted.**

**When the first lots of validators have been created and governance is live we will put the fee structure up for votes if the community deems a change is needed.**
