# Unstaking your Ether with SharedStake

One of the main differences of SharedStake and other protocol is the existence of 'Natural' exit pool. 

We send and lock the ether to eth2 periodically, according to staked balance, or a period of time. Which creates a natural exit pool and insurance to the stakers. After staking to the Eth2 we wait for another period of time, which allows users to unstake if they mistakenly staked or prefered to exit. Anyone can unstake the ether when it is requested that way.

### You can unstake your vEth2 and get your Ether any time you want.

* You can redeem your ether by burning your vEth2 any time requested. 
* It doesn't matter if you staked a minute or a month ago.
* Only inducator is the balance of the [minter contract,](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbca3B7B87dCB15f0efa66136Bc0E4684a3e5da4d) which act as a natural liquidity pool for vEth2.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your profit from Eth2 staking, may be affected by the **amount of time you hold & used vEth2 token.**
{% endhint %}

###  Effects

* This liquidity will provide an exit pool while acting like a method of exchange with the new and old stakers of the pool.
* Since users can withdraw their vEth2, there is no need to worry about the price of vEth2, it will be pegged automatically.
* Users can be sure, and will not be immadiately pushed to lock their amount and wait 2 years
* There is no waiting time, to get your yield bearing representation of Staked Ether.
* There is no claiming transaction necessary
* This Feature will provide a more natural growth for Total Value Locked.
