# ðŸ•´ DAO

The number one priority of the SharedStake DAO is improving the usability and functionality of the protocol by proposing SIPs and voting with SGT.

Being a true decentralized organization is the most important thing for us, because we believe in the power of community as much as we believe in what we code.

### SIPs

SharedStake Improvement Proposals \(SIPs\) describe standards for the SharedStake platform, including core protocol specifications, onchain and offchain implementations, contract improvements and various other protocol strategies.

SGT will function as a governance token on these proposals, DAO members will vote, then core developers will approve & implement.

Anyone can suggest a proposal by providing a draft, simply opening an issue on Github, or even reaching any of the technical contributors from discord, telegram etc.

Voting will occur via snapshot.page.
