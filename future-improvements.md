# âœ¨ Future Improvements

* Additional wallet support added soon
* Improvements to the UI and mobile support are in progress
* Staking operations will be more cost efficient with the auto-staking functionality currently in development
* New validator node additions may incur infrastructure costs but will increase reliability
* Additional AWS regions/VPS providers to increase reliability
* More client choices for new validators: SharedStake is currently using Prysm and there are three additional choices
* Allow members of the community to deploy validators through our smart contracts using KP3R to bond and control permissions for users with a dual bond of KP3R and SST
  * Current concerns with this improvement:
    * Administrative withdrawal key storage
    * Minimum costs for slashing/keeping validators alive
* Move to a more non-custodial or multisig return paradigm
* Implementing SIPs and community feedback
