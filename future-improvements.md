# âœ¨ Future Improvements

* Adding new validator nodes, which incur more infrastructure costs but may increase reliability
* Adding different AWS regions or VPS providers to increase reliability
* Client choices for new validators, there are currently 4 clients to pick from, current choice is Prysm
* Allowing members of the community to deploy validators through our smart contract. Using KP3R to bond and permission control users. With a dual bond of KP3R and SST
  * Open concerns:
    * Withdrawal key storage - give to admin
    * keep validator alive - slashing - min cost?
* Move to a more non-custodial or multisig return paradigm
* More from the community...

**Let's fill this part and make history together with SIPs.**
