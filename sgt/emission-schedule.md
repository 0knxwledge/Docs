**â€¢ SGT has a total supply of 10 million & it is not possible to mint more**

**â€¢ Real circulating supply includes geyser emissions, bounties, vesting tokens, and realistic share from on-demand allocations**

**â€¢ 35% of the total supply is allocated on-demand for protocol improvements and to fund the Treasury. The Treasury provides insurance to SharedStake users and although unlikely to be needed, encourages SGT holders to rest easy and experiment further in DeFi.**

**â€¢ 40% of the token supply is time-locked for 48 months \(until February 2023\) with a multisig time-lock contract.**

**â€¢ Emission rates will be updated quarterly to maximize SGT holders' benefits.**
