# ðŸ“ˆ Distribution & Emission

### **A notable portion of the token supply, 50%, will be distributed to the users of the protocol.** 

The emission period for SGT started with the first airdrop which issued only the initial users. In this airdrop, 100.000 tokens are distributed, which corresponds to 1% of the maximum total supply. 

The emission period will continue for the next 21 months, until November 2022. The emission schedule contains 7 periods with each of them being 3 months long. 

This process is carefully designed with a wide understanding of financial optimization. While the inflation of the token gets lower everyday, the protocol will still provide a maximized profit for its users . The process is also intentionally designed to reward the early users generously.

 **In staking pools:**

* **29% will be distributed for the next 2 years**
* **15,5% locked for the next 2 years**

### **A big portion of the token supply \(40%\) is time locked for the next 2 years, until February 2023, with a multisig time-lock contract.**

The intention of this action is to give our users and investors of the protocol more confidence, since the continuity of most of the protocols are questionable in the world of decentralized finance.

### SharedStake DAO Treasury

Also it is worth mentioning that, 24% of the token supply is allocated to the SharedStake DAO treasury. This treasury will provide insurance to the users of the SharedStake protocol, if ever necessary. This treasury will also create a budget to strengthen the security, and decrease the risks, to create a safer and more reliable protocol.
