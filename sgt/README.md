### SGT stands for SharedStake Governance Token. 

It will function as a governance token of the protocol. 

Firstly, the most important function of the SGT is, distributing the control of the protocol in a decentralized manner. DAO members will be able to vote on SIPs with SGT, to decide on which improvements should be implemented in the protocol, which ones should have more priority, and how to increase the profitability, efficiency and effectiveness of the protocol. While the Protocol gets bigger, DAO will be the beating heart of the protocol, that accepts every memberâ€™s collaboration and contribution.

Secondly, SharedStake incentivizes the migration to Ethereum-2 with SGT. Also creates an easier and more profitable staking process. After you staked your Ether, you can stake your vEth2 to harvest SGT.
