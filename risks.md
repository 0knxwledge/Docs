# üî∫ Risks

**Once staking in ETH2 begins, you will NOT be able to withdraw your deposits until Ethereum Foundation finishes Ethereum 2.0 migration, which is**[ **estimated to deliver in 2021**](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2)**.**

**However, your ETH is pretty safe, for the only place these ETH could be sent to is the ETH2 deposit contract. No one can move those ETH away from the SharedStaking contract, including the team.**

**Also, this will be initialized as a custodial service and migrated to non-custodial later, and it will incur a 5% fee on your Validator reward while you unwrap your vETH2. You should do your own research on the whole ETH2 migration plan, understand what is custodial / non-custodial service, and use at your own risk.**

**We plan to hold the withdrawal keys in multisig down the line to reduce perceived custodial risk.**  


{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that this is a Beta version of the SharedStake. The platform, its software and all content found on it are provided on an ‚Äúas is‚Äù and ‚Äúas available‚Äù basis.

While we have made reasonable efforts to ensure the security and functionality of the SharedStake platform, nothing approaching the rigor of a formal audit has been conducted at this time and the front-end is actively being tested.

We strongly advise caution to anyone who chooses to use the early experimental version.

**PLEASE DO NOT RISK ANY FUNDS YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE.**
