# üî∫ Risks

Once staking in Eth2 begins, you will NOT be able to withdraw your deposits until the Ethereum Foundation finishes the Ethereum 2.0 migration,[ estimated to deliver in 2021](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2).

**Until that time, your ETH is as safe as possible in the protocol. The only place ETH can be sent to is the Eth2 deposit contract and no one can move ETH away from the SharedStaking contract, including the team.**

SharedStake launched initially as a custodial service and is carefully migrating toward non-custodial status. You should research the Eth2 migration plan to understand what is custodial & non-custodial service and use StaaS solutions at your own risk. A five percent fee may be added to your validator reward if you unwrap your vETH2. SharedStake plans to hold withdrawal keys in multisig contracts to reduce perceived custodial risk. Although we plan to use the best security & audit teams available, SharedStake cannot guarantee their efficacy. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that this is a Beta version of the SharedStake protocol. The platform, its software, and all content found on it are provided on an ‚Äúas is‚Äù and ‚Äúas available‚Äù basis.

While we have made reasonable efforts to ensure the security and functionality of the SharedStake platform, nothing approaching the rigor of a formal audit has been conducted at this time and the front-end is actively being tested.

We strongly advise caution to anyone who chooses to use the current experimental version.

**PLEASE DO NOT RISK ANY FUNDS YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE**
