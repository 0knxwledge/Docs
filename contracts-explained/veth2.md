# vEth2

Veth2 is a yield bearing token that represents staked Ether. The contract has a minter address that mints the token whenever an Ether deposited to the minter contract. When 32 eth exceeded, you can call the stake to eth2 function on the minter contract and create a validator. This will lock the Eth deposited into the eth2.
