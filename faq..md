# FAQ

## When was the launch of the protocol?

We concluded our first airdrop with the same time of the launch of the protocol, after 2 months of silence. This airdrop that issued 100.000 SGT to initial stakers, achieved it's purpose. 111 Addresses was eligible, and the smallest contribution rewarded with 260 SGT, which makes approximately 7800$ at the time of writing.

## Can I withdraw my vEth2?

Yes, this is one of the main advantages of the protocol. We lock staked Ether periodically,  you can unstake your balance in the meantime. Also, the current minter contract allows old users to withdraw as well. So, as long as minter contract has enough balance, you can withdraw your Eth anytime you want.

#### Effects

This functionality allows users to exit from protocol if ever requested, unlike the competitors we give more value to the user experience than unhealthily growing TVL.

Because of this functionality 1 vEth2 worth a little more than 1 Eth at the moment. Price of the staked token will be pegged in the future too, since there is always a way out.

#### Future improvements

This functionality may be ineffective in terms of the growth the TVL and any SIPs suggested, voted and approved by the DAO can disable this functionality. However, this is currently unlikely to happen.
