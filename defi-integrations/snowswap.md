# â›„ Snowswap

### We announced the first integration of Defi in our protocol! 

For the first airdrop that aims to distribute the control of the protocol to it's early users, we colloborated with Snowswap. Learn more about our first airdrop:

{% page-ref page="a-storming-launch.md" %}

#### Our Second Colloboration with Snowswap will be a bit different.

For the second colloboration with Snowswap, we will conduct a second airdrop. We proposed an extra APY instead of a fixed SGT amount. With a maximum of 50.000 SGT upperbound \(1.5M$ at the time of writing\), we propose +150% APY on top of Snow rewards for the [Buddy Elf's Pool](https://snowswap.org/stake). This way our users can be sure about their investment, since it will be incentivised by both of the protocols. 

#### To be eligible:

* Stake your vEth2, aETHb, crETH2 or wETH in Snowswap's [eth2snow pool](https://snowswap.org/ethsnow/). 
* Stake your eth2snow token in [buddy elf's pool](https://snowswap.org/stake).
