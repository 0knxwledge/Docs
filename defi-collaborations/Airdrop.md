# â›„ Airdrop #2

{% hint style="success" %}
**The second SGT airdrop is scheduled for 12 April, 2021**
{% endhint %}

#### Our second airdrop will be a bit different

For the second airdrop, we are conducting it on our platform and will be rewarding our loyal community with 52k SGT \(~2.5M USD at the time of writing\)! All you have to do is stake 0.1 vETH2 and 10 $SGT on our Earn page. For those who previously provided vEth2 liquidity on Snowswap- you're already included! (But feel free to add some more SGT or vEth2 to SharedStake pools!) However, addresses that add liquidity on Snowswap OR continue to hold SNOW after March 14 will not be included in the airdrop. This is to make sure we are dropping as much SGT into the wallets of our community.


#### The airdrop is scheduled for 12 April, 2021 at 11:59PM EST.
