# üìè Ruler Protocol

Good ideas need partners. And SharedStake found one in [Ruler Protocol](https://rulerprotocol.com/). 

Ruler Protocol is a market-driven lending platform with non-liquidatable loans where users can borrow cryptocurrency & lenders provide DAI and mint rcTokens against the asset. LPs provide DAI/rc-Tokens in AMMs, and borrowers deposit their collateral to receive rc-Tokens \(sold for DAI\) and rr-Tokens. See [Ruler‚Äôs docs](https://docs.rulerprotocol.com/user-guide/farming/add-liquidity/adding-with-the-zap) for detailed information on Ruler's value proposition.

**What does this mean for SGT users?**

The passage of the SharedStake DAO's [SIP-4](https://snapshot.org/#/sharedstake.eth/proposal/QmXcNnYfKHhZuNjt2ax1dnK8Eixq9XSFutYxe2qeQGkyRG) approved a vETH2/DAI market on Ruler Protocol. Users can deposit vETH2 to mint rc-vETH2/rr-vETH2. 

This allows for a liquidity pool on Curve that will enable users to provide liquidity to an rc-vETH2/3CRV pool and earn rewards in SGT & RULER \(as liquidity mining incentives\). Initial liquidity was seeded from the SGT Treasury and dedicated vETH2 holders. These pools earn SGT + RULER as rewards.
