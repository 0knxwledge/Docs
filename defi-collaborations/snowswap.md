# ðŸ¥© Airdrop 2

After a significant increase in SharedStake TVL and community engagement, the second airdrop details were revised for SGT-holders' benefit.

**Who qualifies for the airdrop?**

* Pool 1 \(SGT\): 42.5% of the airdrop will be allocated in this pool. 
  * Min holding for eligibility: 10 SGT
* Pool 2 \(SGT/ETH\): 35% of the airdrop will be allocated in this pool. 
  * Min holding for eligibility: - liquidity pool token equivalent to 10 SGT + equivalent amount of ETH
* Pool 3 \(vETH2\): 22.5% of the airdrop will be allocated in this pool. 
  * Min holding for eligibility: 0.1 vETH.

To clarify, it is still **one** airdrop but you will qualify per your value staked in each pool in accordance with the distribution split.

For SnowSwap users who previously provided liquidity, you may still be eligible: if you provided vETH2 liquidity to SnowSwap before 14 March, 2021, your airdrop will follow the previous reward structure for the 02 Feb to 14 March period. Current and new LPs who choose to continue providing liquidity for SnowSwap after 14 March will not earn any additional rewards through Airdrop 2.
