{% hint style="success" %}
**The second SGT airdrop is scheduled sometime between 02-07 April, 2021**
{% endhint %}

#### Our second collaboration with SnowSwap will be a bit different

For the second collaboration with SnowSwap, we plan to airdrop additional yield \(APY\) instead of a fixed SGT amount. With a maximum of 50,000 SGT \($3M at the time of writing\), we plan to increase SNOW rewards on the [Buddy Elf's Pool](https://snowswap.org/stake) by 150% APY.  The purpose of this airdrop is to reward both communities, increase the utility of SnowSwap and SharedStake products, and maximize profits for SNOW and SGT holders.

#### To be eligible:

* Stake your vEth2, aETHb, crETH2 or wEth in SnowSwap's [eth2SNOW Pool](https://snowswap.org/ethsnow/)
* Stake your eth2SNOW token in [Buddy Elf's Pool](https://snowswap.org/stake)

#### Airdrop details may change up until February 21st, 2021.
