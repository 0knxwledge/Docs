{% hint style="success" %}
**The second SGT airdrop is scheduled for sometime between 02-07 April, 2021**
{% endhint %}

#### Our second collaboration will be a bit different

For the second collaboration, we may airdrop additional yield \(APY\) instead of a fixed SGT amount. With a maximum value of 50,000 SGT \($3M at the time of writing\), we plan to increase DeFi partner rewards by up to 150% APY.  The purpose of this airdrop is to reward both communities, increase the utility of SharedStake and partner products, and maximize profits for SGT holders and supporters of our colleagues.


#### Airdrop details are under review, pending current events. The airdrop is still sheduled for 02-07 April, 2021.
