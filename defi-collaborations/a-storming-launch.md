# A Snowy Launch

The first SharedStake airdrop coincided with the launch of the protocol after two months of hard work in relative stealth. The airdrop issued 100,000 SGT to our initial stakers and resulted in 111 eligible addresses receiving SGT \(the smallest reward was 260 SGT, worth about $15,000 as of mid-February\).

#### To be eligible for the airdrop, initial stakers:

* Staked at least 0.5 ETH on the SharedStake platform
* Held their vEth2 _or_ deposited it in the Eth2Snow pool on SnowSwap
* Held at least 10 SNOW in their wallet \(this included SNOW deposited in Frosty's Pool\).
