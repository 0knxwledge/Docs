# ü§ù Defi Collaborations

One of the most important things to keep in mind is, vEth2 is as functional as we collaborate and encourage its usage on the other protocols. In our roadmap, after the first half of 2021 we will have a _solid_ mechanism that will allow us to collaborate with other protocols more efficiently, while incentivizing the protocol‚Äôs users more. After 2 years, which concludes our roadmap so far, we are planning to be \#1 ethereum staking protocol with the contributions of these collaborations...

We already integrated with Snowswap for a liquidity pool to provide extra liquidity on vEth2.

The Liquidity providers will get their incentives with a second airdrop in the first week of April, 2 months after the launch of the protocol.



### Stay tuned for more information!
