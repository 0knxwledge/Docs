# ü§ù Defi Collaborations

Like any valuable asset, vEth2 is as functional as its use cases require. Collaboration with other protocols is increases the value and usage of SharedStake products. We will continue to announce additional partnerships and encourage our community to [let us know](https://twitter.com/SharedStake) their thoughts. The second half of 2021 will see SharedStake tokens in continued collaboration with additional protocols. 

vEth2 holders/stakers will benefit from the increased utility in the yield-bearing token, and SGT holders will have additional avenues for growth.

The successful integration with [Snowswap](https://snowswap.org/) increased the liquidity pool for vEth2 and airdropped thousands of SGT to our community. Another airdrop is planned for the first week of April and will reward community members & liquidity providers.



### Stay tuned for more information!
