# ü§ù Defi Collaborations

Like any valuable asset, vEth2 is as functional as its use cases require. Collaboration with other projects increases the value and usage of SharedStake products. We will continue to announce additional partnerships and encourage our community to [let us know](https://twitter.com/SharedStake) their thoughts. The second half of 2021 will see SharedStake tokens in continued collaboration with additional DeFi partners. 

{% hint style="success" %}
We endeavor to update our docs as often as possible, but please consider this page a static resource. New partnerships and use cases can be found on our [social channels](https://twitter.com/SharedStake), on [SharedStake](https://www.sharedstake.org/), or in our [SIPs](https://snapshot.org/#/sharedstake.eth).
{% endhint %}

### Stay tuned for more information!
