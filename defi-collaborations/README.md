# ü§ù Defi Collaborations

Like any valuable asset, vEth2 is as functional as its use cases require. Collaboration with other protocols is paramount to increasing the value and usage of SharedStake products. In the current roadmap, the second half of 2021 will have a tested and accepted mechanism to allow SharedStake ease in continued collaboration with additional protocols efficiently. 

This will create a positive cycle: the protocol‚Äôs users will use the tokens more and request its addition to other protocols, which will increase its value and maximize the benefits to SGT holders.

Our successful integration with [Snowswap](https://snowswap.org/) increased the liquidity pool for vEth2 and airdropped thousands of SGT to our community. Another airdrop is planned for the first week of April and will reward community members and/or liquidity providers.



### Stay tuned for more information!
